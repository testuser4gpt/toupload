How to untrack a file in github
git reset FileName




Staging and Committing Changes :

    Adding files to the staging area with    "git add <file>" OR " git add . " (tracks all files)
    Committing changes with  (git commit -m "commit message")
    Viewing commit history with     "git log".
     

    Note that : The HEAD (MASTER) is a pointer which changes to latest commit


To get back to certain past before changes :
    
    git log to copy the hashcode 
    git checkout <Hashcode>
    git checkout master (To get back to latest edit)
    git branch (To check which branch we are at Or The number of branches in repo)


Checkout, Branches, Merge

    To make a branch "git branch <branch name>"
    To switch to certain branch "git checkout <branch>"
    Creating branches and switching to them in one command with "git checkout -b <branch_name>"
    Merging branches using "git merge <branch>" (Note you have to go to parent branch to make changes)
    git branch --delete <branchname>
    git push origin --delete homepage/category
    git push --set-upstream origin modelsetup



    Note that the new branch we make over some certain branch copies everything


Git hub :
    git remote add origin <repo url>
    after pushing our repo to github we use remote -v to see remote urls
    git push -u origin 

    Note that we will need to push every branch we made. so check out to branch then git push -u origin <branch name>
