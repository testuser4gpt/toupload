npm init
npm install package_name
also
npm install package_name@version

npm install --save-dev nodemon (installed as dev dependency)

npm install -g PackageName
also we can use i in place of install
npm i -g PackageName

to check npm package version 
npm list PackageName
// npm list express

to run packages which are installed locally you gotta use 
npx nodemon filename
