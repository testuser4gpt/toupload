jsend JSON DATA (jsend Json formatting)


when sending post data as json. No need to add id parameter, it will be added automatically

middleware is just a step which sits between the req and res, It modifies the req,res data

# Middlewares
we can see that the middlewares being executed only when we calls them using browser. since they sit on between
req, res 

# we can add scripts in package.json
under scripts :
"scriptTriggerName" : script

ex : 
"start" : npx nodemon server.js

now just use npm start
// the script will trigger

# I dont understand this router.params
# Node env are also left
